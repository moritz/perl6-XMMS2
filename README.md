# perl6-XMMS2

An XMMS2 client module for Perl 6 and a command line tool to use it with, inspired by tadzik++'s
[perl6-MPD](//github.com/tadzik/perl6-MPD). It's actually based on the xmms2-tutorial C code.

Currently it connects (in a hacky way), and that's about it. Even if it did work, only the “play”
function is implemented anyway.

You can look at the pretty code though.
